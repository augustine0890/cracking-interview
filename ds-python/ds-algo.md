# How to solve the problem
0. Don't Panic!
1. What are the inputs?
2. What are the outputs?
3. Solve the problem!
    - Understand the Relationship: work out examples
    - Consider systematically how a human solves the problem
4. Simple mechanical solution
5. Develop incrementally and test as we go
- Processor: ~ 1B instructions per second <--> 1ns/inst
