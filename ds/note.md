# Graph
- Degree of a Vertex: total number of edges incident on a vertex
- Parallel Edges: two undirected edges are parallel if they have the same end vertices. Two directed edges are parallel if they have the same starting and ending vertices.
- Self Loop: this occurs when an edge starts and ends on the same vertex.
- Adjacency: two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge between them directly.
- Directed Graph: $$n(n-1) \ possible \ edges$$
- Undirected Graph: $$(n*(n-1))/2 \ maximum \ possible \ edges$$
- The two most common ways to represent a graph are:
  - Adjacency Matrix: for a directed graph, the usual convention is to think of the rows as sources and the columns as destination.
  - Adjacency List
